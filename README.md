You can create your own line-bot project and corresponding keys from [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).  
Both ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY are required to the LINE Messaging API access.  
Copy and paste both of the keys to the vars.json.

{
  "Parameters": {
    "CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "*****",
    "CHANNEL_SECRET": "*****"
  }
}
```

sam build
```

sam local start-api --env-vars vars.json
```

## Usage

#### 1. Make http to https
```
ngrok http 3000
```

#### 2. Register https link
Register the https link to [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) as **Webhook URL**.  
This will enable us to communicate with the bot.

#### 3. Access from LINE!
Open your LINE App and add this bot. (By the QR code would be fine)  
Chat a message to the bot. You would get the echo message.
